eshell history completing-read for M-r

- Changed `M-o` to `M-l` for `my-jump-keymap` keybinding.
- Switched `M-l` to `M-o` for `bookmark-jump`.
- Added and reorganized `my-win-keymap` keybindings (e.g., `b` for toggling `tab-bar-mode`, `r` for `my/rainbow-mode`).
- Adjusted `org-todo-keyword-faces` with updated less saturated colors.
- Enhanced eshell setup:
  - Appended Bash history to eshell history on load.
  - Introduced `my/eshell-history-completing-read`.

** <2025-01-06>

Add keybinding and enhance Org mode TODO workflow

- Added `C-;` keybinding for `my/comment-or-uncomment`.
- Extended `org-todo-keywords` with new states: `ORDR` and `SENT`.
- Updated `org-todo-keyword-faces` to include styling for `ORDR` and `SENT`.

** <2025-01-01>

Update keybindings and improve deferred loading for =diff-mode=

- Changed backup keybinding from =C-c b= to =<f12>= to align with function key usage 
  for global/system actions.
- Updated =diff-mode= keybinding adjustments to use =with-eval-after-load=:
  - Ensures =M-j= and =M-k= bindings are unset only after =diff-mode= is loaded.
  - Prevents potential issues with uninitialized =diff-mode-map=.
- No changes to functionality; these updates improve keybinding management and load behavior.

** <2024-12-31>

Refactor and update keybindings, configuration, and package setup

- Removed unused or redundant global keybindings, such as:
  - `C-x ;` (my/switch-to-thing)
  - `M-'` (set-mark-command)
  - `M-;` and `M-c` (delete-other-windows)
  - Others redundant to existing functionality or cleanup.
- Updated `M-l` keybinding to `bookmark-jump` from `split-window-horizontally`.
- Unset keybindings in `diff-mode-map` for `M-j` and `M-k`.

- Adjusted package configurations:
  - Removed `gptel`-related setup as it is no longer needed.
  - Updated `chatgpt-shell` quick access command binding from `?l` to `?j`.

** <2024-12-29>

Add "Issues" section and link TODOs to project features in README

- Added a new "Issues" section with TODOs, each linked to related project features.
- Supplemented the section with Emacs Lisp code to auto-generate issue tables.

** <2024-12-28>

Add new Org navigation keybinding and improve Org mode settings

- Added `M-g o` keybinding for `org-goto`, enabling quick navigation within Org files.
- Changed `M-g i` keybinding from using a quoted symbol ('imenu) to a proper function reference (#'imenu).
- Configured Org mode with:
  - `org-goto-interface` set to `outline-path-completionp` for enhanced navigation.
  - `org-outline-path-complete-in-steps` set to `nil` for smoother interface behavior.

** <2024-12-20>

Refactor README.org: Streamline sections and cleanup

- *Cleanup of Redundant Code*:
  - Removed the `my/sync-tab-bar-to-theme` function, which is no longer relevant to the core configuration.
  - Removed the `spelling-core` section, simplifying the configuration by relying on minimal spell-checking features and eliminating auxiliary tools like `hunspell`.

** <2024-12-19>

- Added new settings and sections:
  - `org-agenda-core`: Customized Org Agenda views with yearly and monthly displays.
  - `dwim`: Enhanced "Do What I Mean" functionalities for common operations like file conversion and tagging.
- Introduced a comprehensive build menu (`build-menu`) with CMake integration, custom commands, and keybindings.
- Updated `image-dired` configuration for streamlined image navigation, thumbnails, and management.
- Added new utilities for project and build management (e.g., `change-directory-and-run`, `list-cmake-presets`).
- Refined custom abbrev definitions across multiple modes.

** <2024-12-18>

Replaced =tempel= with =abbrev-mode= by modifying the config files.

** <2024-12-16>

feat(emacs): Enhance =dired= and =image-dired= configurations

- *=dired=*:
  - Added a new keybinding (=C-c i=) for =my/image-dired-sort=.
  - Improved file management capabilities within Dired interface.

- *Spell-checking*:
  - Integrated =dictionary.el= for on-the-fly word definitions.
  - Added =C-c s d= for dictionary lookup.
  - Introduced =C-0= as dedicated keybinding for =ispell-word=.

- *=image-dired=*:
  - Introduced custom behavior for image manipulation:
    - Added =my/image-dired-sort= for better image sorting in Dired.
    - Defined keybindings to streamline navigation and editing in =image-dired=.
  - Configured a split-buffer layout for enhanced productivity.
  - Added helper functions (=my/image-save-as=, =my/delete-current-image-and-move-to-next=, etc.) for managing images programmatically.
  - Enabled external image viewing via =gthumb=.

** <2024-12-14>

Added my/find-file to be a more flexible ripgrep based finding file tool.

** <2024-12-14>

Added deadgrep kind of replacement called my/grep with leveraging ripgrep into a type of grep Emacs buffer.

** <2024-12-10>

Added ada-mode support out of the box.

Yes, ada-mode was removed from emacs and it was recommended to use the ada-mode supplied by AdaCore, however this is all but impossible to set up so including =ada-light=mode= as part of the configuration.

  - Improved window sorting logic for more accurate top-to-bottom, left-to-right navigation.
  - Added visual overlays to display window shortcuts with labels.
- Introduced `my/rainbow-mode`:
  - Overlays hex color values in buffers with their respective colors for better readability.
- Minor refactor to `my/copy-buffer-to-kill-ring` by removing redundant `save-excursion`.
- Corrected a typo: Renamed `identation-core` to `indentation-core`.
